        <h2>Ingredients You Will Need</h2>
        <p>Sugar, Water, Wooden Skewers, Clips, and a Glass Jar</p>
        <p>Other options that you can include can be some Food coloring and Flavor Extract</p>
        
        <h2>Step 1: Getting the Sugar Solution Ready</h2>
        <p>Start with a pan of water. Once boiling, mix in sugar till the solution becomes syrupy and thick.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Adding Extras</h2>
        <p>Once at a syrupy solution, make sure to turn off the heat before adding anything like food coloring or flavoring.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Pouring the solution</h2>
        <p>Slowly pour the sugary solution into the glass jar. Once filled, stick the wooden skewer in the middle of the jar, using the clip, and suspend it over the open jar to keep it in place.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 4: Wait For the Crystals</h2>
        <p>Thats is all there is to it. Store it in an undisturbed environment once you have it all in place. Cover it with a paper towel to prevent dust from falling. Check back on it between 5-7 days.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Final Result</h2>
        <p> If you did all the steps correctly, you should have crystals forming all over the skewer! Rock candy can form any way around the stick so it can always be different. You can eat it directly or even use it as a sweetener.</p>
